#  Water Pollution Control Simulator

An interactive web-based simulation that visualizes how human activities impact water ecosystems and how sustainable decisions can restore environmental balance.

---

## Problem Statement
Water pollution caused by industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and improper waste disposal severely affects aquatic ecosystems. These impacts are often difficult to understand without clear visual representation.

This project provides a **visual and interactive simulation** to demonstrate how pollution spreads, how ecosystems degrade over time, and how corrective actions can help restore water quality.

---

##  Solution Overview
The Water Pollution Control Simulator models a water body divided into zones. Each zone maintains pollution levels and ecosystem health indicators. Users can introduce pollution sources, apply cleanup measures, and observe **real-time visual feedback** through animations and graphs.

The focus is on **cause → effect → recovery**, making environmental concepts easy to understand and engaging.

##  Key Features
-  Visual river/lake simulation
-  Pollution sources (industry, agriculture, waste dumping)
-  Cleanup actions (filters, treatment, regulations)
-  Ecosystem health visualization
-  Water Quality Index (WQI)
-  Time-lapse simulation
-  Scenario-based “What-if” analysis

---

##  Approach
1. The water body is divided into multiple zones.
2. Each zone tracks pollution levels and ecosystem health.
3. Pollution sources increase contamination over time.
4. Pollution spreads gradually to neighboring zones.
5. Cleanup actions reduce pollution progressively.
6. Visual indicators represent ecosystem degradation or recovery.

The simulation emphasizes **decision impact rather than complex scientific equations**.
